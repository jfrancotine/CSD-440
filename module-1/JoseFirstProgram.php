Hello everyone, I hope you are all doing well and had an amazing break. 
My name is Jose Franco and I am originally from Venezuela. In 2017, I moved to Chile, and two years later, in 2019, I decided to move here to the United States. 
I am currently living in Flower Mound, TX with my wife and our husky, Enzo.

Professionally, I am pursuing my second bachelor’s degree in software development. My first degree back home was in business. 
I currently work at Target as a team leader, and it has been a great experience and opportunity, especially since they are covering the cost of this program.

In my free time, I enjoy serving at church, particularly in the Spanish ministry, and going bowling, a sport I’ve loved since growing up in Venezuela. 
I was even able to compete professionally, participating in several state championships.

I am very excited for this term, especially to learn more about PHP and creating dynamic web pages. 
I use Discord often and have already made great connections with classmates, helping each other out along the way. 
If you ever need a hand and I can help, please don’t hesitate to reach out — my username is jose_03186.

My ultimate career goal is to join a tech company where I can apply everything I’ve learned so far. 
I especially enjoy back-end development, but in the long run, I aim to grow into a full-stack developer. 
Throughout this program, I have gained valuable experience in Java, Python, SQL, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, 
and I plan to use these skills to build efficient, scalable, and impactful applications that solve real-world problems.

I wish you all the best in this new and for many last term before graduation.

Jose");?>
